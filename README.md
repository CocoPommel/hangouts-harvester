# hangouts-harvester
Batch script to turn .csv files extracted from hangouts into intelligible lines, only taking messages from one user

**How to use:**
1: Download your hangouts history to a folder using https://hangoutparser.jay2k1.com/. *Make sure to download as zipped .csv files, otherwise the script will not work.*

2: Rename the zip folder to hangouts-export

3: Run the batch file in the same folder that countains the zip hangouts-export.zip. If all goes well, the filtered text should appear in the file output.log.
